## About Me

I am a first year PhD student at Boston University, Faculty of Computing & Data Sciences in the Kolachalama Laboratory. I am advised by Professor Vijaya B. Kolachalama, BU School of Medicine. I received my Master's degree in Computer Science from Boston University. Before joining BU, I received a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from RV College of Engineering, Bengaluru, India. My research interests fall under the umbrella of multimodal representation learning and deep learning. I am interested in applying machine learning methods for the assessment of neurodegenerative disorders.
