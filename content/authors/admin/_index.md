## About Me

I am a third year PhD student in the [Faculty of Computing and Data Sciences](https://www.bu.edu/cds-faculty/) at Boston University, currently working with Dr. [Vijaya B. Kolachalama](https://vkola-lab.github.io). I hold a Master's degree in Computer Science from Boston University. Prior to joining BU, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering at RV College of Engineering in Bengaluru, India. My research broadly focuses on post-training methods of Large Language Models (LLMs), with a current interest in leveraging LLMs to assess neurodegenerative disorders through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR).
