      Responsibilities include:
      - Utilizing Python’s pandas and sklearn libraries to efficiently process large volumes of non-imaging data from various cohorts to create a master dataset for training the model
      - Working on developing an end to end transformer based pipeline for identifying different dementia etiologies using brain scan MRI and non-imaging data
      - Researching ways to improve the model performance by experimenting with different loss functions and utilizing different strategies to tackle the class imbalance problem

      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.
