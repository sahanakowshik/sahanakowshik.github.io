abstract: Differential diagnosis of dementia remains a challenge in neurology due
  to symptom overlap across etiologies, yet it is crucial for formulating early, personalized
  management strategies. Here, we present an artificial intelligence (AI) model that
  harnesses a broad array of data, including demographics, individual and family medical
  history, medication use, neuropsychological assessments, functional evaluations
  and multimodal neuroimaging, to identify the etiologies contributing to dementia
  in individuals. The study, drawing on 51,269 participants across 9 independent,
  geographically diverse datasets, facilitated the identification of 10 distinct dementia
  etiologies. It aligns diagnoses with similar management strategies, ensuring robust
  predictions even with incomplete data. Our model achieved a microaveraged area under
  the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.94 in classifying individuals
  with normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment and dementia. Also, the microaveraged
  AUROC was 0.96 in differentiating the dementia etiologies. Our model demonstrated
  proficiency in addressing mixed dementia cases, with a mean AUROC of 0.78 for two
  co-occurring pathologies. In a randomly selected subset of 100 cases, the AUROC
  of neurologist assessments augmented by our AI model exceeded neurologist-only evaluations
  by 26.25%. Furthermore, our model predictions aligned with biomarker evidence and
  its associations with different proteinopathies were substantiated through postmortem
  findings. Our framework has the potential to be integrated as a screening tool for
  dementia in clinical settings and drug trials. Further prospective studies are needed
  to confirm its ability to improve patient care.
