abstract: 'Differential diagnosis of dementia remains a challenge in neurology due
  to symptom overlap across etiologies, yet it is crucial for formulating early, personalized
  management strategies. Here, we present an AI model that harnesses a broad array
  of data, including demographics, individual and family medical history, medication
  use, neuropsychological assessments, functional evaluations, and multimodal neuroimaging,
  to identify the etiologies contributing to dementia in individuals. The study, drawing
  on 51, 269 participants across 9 independent, geographically diverse datasets, facilitated
  the identification of 10 distinct dementia etiologies. It aligns diagnoses with
  similar management strategies, ensuring robust predictions even with incomplete
  data. Our model achieved a micro-averaged area under the receiver operating characteristic
  curve (AUROC) of 0.94 in classifying individuals with normal cognition, mild cognitive
  impairment and dementia. Also, the micro-averaged AUROC was 0.96 in differentiating
  the dementia etiologies. Our model demonstrated proficiency in addressing mixed
  dementia cases, with a mean AUROC of 0.78 for two cooccurring pathologies. In a
  randomly selected subset of 100 cases, the AUROC of neurologist assessments augmented
  by our AI model exceeded neurologist-only evaluations by 26.25%. Furthermore, our
  model predictions aligned with biomarker evidence and its associations with different
  proteinopathies were substantiated through postmortem findings. Our framework has
  the potential to be integrated as a screening tool for dementia in various clinical
  settings and drug trials, with promising implications for person-level management.Competing
  Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis
  project was supported by various grants.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant
  ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee
  approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant
  consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived,
  and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone
  (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research
  group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical
  trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with
  an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov. I confirm that any such
  study reported in the manuscript has been registered and the trial registration
  ID is provided (note: if posting a prospective study registered retrospectively,
  please provide a statement in the trial ID field explaining why the study was not
  registered in advance).YesI have followed all appropriate research reporting guidelines,
  such as any relevant EQUATOR Network research reporting checklist(s) and other pertinent
  material, if applicable.YesAll data produced in the present study are available
